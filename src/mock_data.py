mock_data.py  --  Fake data so Pod C can build before Pod B is ready.

Decision 1 (scope): one topic chain from a machine-learning lecture series --
Derivatives -> Chain Rule -> Gradient Descent -> Neural Networks, with a
Loss Function branch. Six concepts, enough to show a real prerequisite graph.

Decision 3 (mock data): 6 concepts and 12 questions (MCQ, short, numeric),
so every code path has something to run against. When Pod B ships the real
graph, swap these functions out; nothing else changes.
