report.py  --  Piece 5: the post-assessment report.

After a quiz, this produces the "you're weak here, and here's why" summary the
rubric asks for. It does three things:

  1. Per-question feedback -- for every answer, the correct answer and a
     citation back to the source (slide / page / timestamp).
  2. Weak topics -- the concepts the student is weakest at, ranked.
  3. Likely misconceptions -- for each wrong answer, the common mistake behind it.

For a demo the misconceptions come from a small curated table below. In the
full system an LLM would write them from the student's actual wrong answer --
the function `llm_misconception()` is the hook for that.
